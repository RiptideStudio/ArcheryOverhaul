From the creators of Sorcery Overhaul comes Archery Overhaul!

Archery Overhaul doesn't just add in more bows and arrows; it creates a better archery experience. Here are some of the unique features Archery Overhaul has to offer.:

. Critical hits on arrows create a splash-damaging shockwave
. Blur effect on arrows when reaching high speeds
. Arrow impacts have custom sounds and particle effects
. Quivers visually equip onto the player
. New Crossbows have a right-click functionality
. Arrow Pouches drop from enemies, which scale with game progression
. All ranged weapons have autoswing by default
. Full bar conversion
. Alternate recipes for vanilla items (e.g., Hermes boots, Anklet of the Wind)

This mod currently adds in the following 150+ items:

. 50+ New Bows
. 25 New Arrows
. 6 New Crossbow Variants
. 30 New Accessories
. 8 Equippable Quivers with visual effects
. 4 New armor sets
. 15 New Materials
. 5 New Arrow Grenades
. 8 New Loot Bags
. 1 New NPC
. 1 New Potion
. 1 New Enemy
. 10+ New Recipes for vanilla items

And much more!
